The goal of the Assignment was to establish connection with "Ithaki" Server, send (byte-byte) requests for packages and receive them. Those packages, were:
<ul>
<li> Echo packages, with a specific format. </li>
<li> Image packages, received and save as .jpeg files. </li>
<li> Global Positioning System (GPS) traces, received and printed on a (satelite) image. </li>
<li> Usage of Automatic Repeat Request (<b>ARQ</b>) (an error-control mechanism) to deal with package losses.</li>
</ul>
